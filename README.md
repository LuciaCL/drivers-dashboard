# Drivers Dashboard

Frontend Engineer Exercise

Driver Dashboard is a basic example about drivers, where they are located, and orders.
We have a list of orders on the left hand side of the screen and a map on the right hand side.
When we click in an order, in the map we have highlighted in red the trucks that are closer.

You need a to create an apiKey.json file in /src/data like the following:

```
{
    "apiKey":"YOUR_KEY"
}
```

To run the example do the following:

```
$ cd drivers-dashboard
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
